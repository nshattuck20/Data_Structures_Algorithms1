# The following program gets some input from user and then prints the length of the 
# string as output. 

# user_input = input('Please enter a phrase: ')
# print("This phrase has : " + str(len(user_input)) + "characters")

#You can also grab indexes of strings using brackets like 
#'phrase[0]' returns string at index 0. 

#Using negative numbers in brackets is fine as well. 
#Returns index at the end and works backwardsÂ 

alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
print(alphabet[12]) #returns character at index 12 
print(alphabet[-5])
