''' The main takeaway from this section is that there are two types of instances: 
1. Class 
2. Instance
Class instances are like factories that produce instance level instances. 

Objects contain two types of attributes 
1. Class attributes - visible to all instances
2. Instance attributes - visible only to that instance 

Python searches for a particular instance by starting in the instance namespeace, then searches 
the class namespace
